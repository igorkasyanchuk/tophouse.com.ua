== Responders

A set of responders modules to dry up your Rails application. This branch (v0.4) is meant
to be used with Rails 2.3 with Inherited Resources. Check the master branch for Rails 3
version.

* FlashResponder - Sets the flash based on the controller action and resource status.
  For instance, if you do: respond_with(@post) on a POST request and the resource @post
  does not contain errors, it will automatically set the flash message to
  "Post was successfully created" as long as you configure your I18n file:

    flash:
      actions:
        create:
          notice: "{resource_name} was successfully created"
        update:
          notice: "{resource_name} was successfully updated"
        destroy:
          alert: "{resource_name} could not be destroyed"

  In case the resource contains errors, you should use the failure key on I18n. This is
  useful to dry up flash messages from your controllers. If you need a specific message
  for a controller, let's say, for PostsController, you can also do:

    flash:
      posts:
        create:
          notice: "Your post was created and will be published soon"

  This responder is activated in all non get requests. By default it will use the keys
  :notice and :alert, but they can be changed as well:

    Responders::FlashResponder.flash_keys = [ :success, :failure ]

* HttpCacheResponder - Automatically adds Last-Modified headers to API requests. This
  allows clients to easily query the server if a resource changed and if the client tries
  to retrieve a resource that has not been modified, it returns not_modified status.
