= ArEnumerations plugin

ArEnumerations is a simple Rails plugin which brings transparent enums to ActiveRecord objects. It doesn't require native database
support for enums or sets, instead of this it stores values as plain integers.

Test application could be found here: http://github.com/igorkasyanchuk/ar_enumerations_test_application.

== Example

ArEnumerations usage is simple:


  # Migration
  create_table :foos do |t|
    t.column :days, :integer
    t.column :selected_day, :integer
  end

  # Model
  class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
    MONDAY = "Monday"
    FRIDAY = "Friday"
    SUNDAY = "Sunday"

    DAYS = [MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY]

    enumeration_for :days, DAYS
    enumeration_for :selected_day, DAYS, :single => true
  end

After this you can set foo's days with strings:

  @foot.days
  # => nil

  @foo.days = Foo::DAYS
  @foo.selected_day = Foo::MONDAY

  @foo.days
  # => ["Monday", "Friday", "Sunday"]

  @foo[:days]  # In such way you can get value which will actually be stored in DB
  # => 2

And you can work with bitfield attributes as regular arrays:

  @foo.selected_day
  # => nil

  @foo.selected_day = Foo::MONDAY
  @foo.selected_day
  # => "Monday"

==  Getting ArEnumeration value for specified values

Sometimes (for example, in search queries) you need to ArEnumeration value.

  class Foo < ActiveRecord::Base
    validates_presence_of :name
    MONDAY = "Monday"
    FRIDAY = "Friday"
    SUNDAY = "Sunday"
    DAYS = [MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY]
    enumeration_for :days, DAYS
    enumeration_for :selected_day, DAYS, :single => true
    named_scope :sundays, :conditions => { :selected_day => enumeration_attribute_db_value(:selected_day, Foo::SUNDAY) }
  end

== Handling of incorrect values

ArEnumerations columns will handle all incorrect (unspecified) values as +nil+:

  @foo.selected_day = 'other day'
  @foo.selected_day
  # => nil
